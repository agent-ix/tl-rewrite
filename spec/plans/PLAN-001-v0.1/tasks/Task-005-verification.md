# Task-005: Verification and review remediation

## Scope

Run the full local MSRV, lint, test, documentation, corpus, supply-chain,
specification, and integrity gates, then resolve actionable pull-request
findings.

## Completion Evidence

The complete local gate, Rust 1.75 all-target build, and final feedback audit
pass after remediation of the actionable automated-review findings. The exact
evidence record remains Task-006.
